<H3>Ping sending</H3>

<H4>Who send ping ?</H4>There are four methods. <br />
(1)  An administrator send ping manually. <br />
<br />
(2)  When displaying a new report block, send ping. <br />
In admin &quot;Preferences&quot; page,<br />
mark &quot;Send Ping&quot; of &quot;What's New&quot; block. <br />
Since ping server may have a slow reaction, <br />
a display of the part and a block becomes slow. <br />
<br />
(3) When you access special URL, send ping. <br />
It is  assumed that<br />
this function is called periodically by wget or others. <br />
It is necessary to be a server's administrator.&quot; <br />
<br />
Add The following line to crontab. <br />

<TABLE class=SoftwareInstall>
<TR>
<TD>11 * * * * usr/bin/wget http : //xxx/modules/whatsnew/bin/update_ping.php?pass=<B>???</B> -q -O /dev/null<br />
      </TD>
    </TR>
  
</TABLE>
<br />
<B>???</B>&nbsp;is the password of update_ping.php,<br />
which is set up in admin &quot;Preferences&quot; page.<br />
<br />
(4)  When submit or modify a airtcle, send ping. <br />
This method should be given in the first time.<br />
In order to perform this, <br />
it is necessary to change all the programs of the corresponding modules. <br />
<H4>Where send ping ?</H4>
The following ping server is prepared by the default. <br />
<TABLE class=SoftwareInstall>
    <TR>
      <TD>http://rpc.weblogs.com/<br />
      http://xxx/modules/whatsnew/bin/server.php (debug use)<br />
      </TD>
    </TR>
  </TABLE>
<br />Since it is processing in order, <br />
processing time is required by the number of ping servers. <br />
I regard about at least three as enough. <br />
<br />
The last ping server is prepared for the debugging use. <br />
Please delete, if a response occurs will be OK. <br />
